### Hello fellow Githubers

Here you can find my static site which I build for Project tech! I don't really know if you (Janno) 
are going to give me a grade for this feature or my back-end feature which includes better HTML and Javascript (actually just
everything). If so, you are now on the wrong page. To see the back-end feature which also includes the good HTML and Javascript, 
go [here](https://github.com/ParvinBDJ/Dating-App/tree/master/back-end/week3).
