### Hello fellow Githubers

Here you can find my static site which I build for Project tech! I don't really know if you (Janno) 
are going to give me a grade for this or my back-end feature which includes better HTML and Javascript. If so, you are now
on the wrong page. To see the back-end feature which also includes the good HTML and Javascript, 
go [here](https://github.com/ParvinBDJ/Dating-App/tree/master/back-end/week3).
