### Hello fellow Githuber

Here you can find my static site which I build for Project tech! I don't really know if you (Janno) 
are going to give me a grade for this feature or my back-end feature which includes better HTML and Javascript (actually just
everything). If so, you are now on the wrong page. To see the back-end feature which also includes the good HTML and Javascript, 
go [here](https://github.com/ParvinBDJ/Dating-App/tree/master/back-end/week3).

#### The static site
This static site is based on my feature which is made for Project Tech. It was the first start to my feature and is the 
beginning of the end feature. I hope you like it! _If give me pull request, maybe I can change somethings_
